## GPT Training Pipeline

A Kubeflow pipeline is implemented to train up a toy GPT model and use it to generate text in response to user prompts.
1. Load raw data
2. Slice and dice data sets to prepare for training
3. Train up a DL model
4. Use the model to forecast

Hope the exercise can serve as a template for building other pipelines that involve similar train jobs.
